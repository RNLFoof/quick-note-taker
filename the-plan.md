Okay uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

I want to be able to quickly get notes out of my brain largely regardless of situation. The biggest problem is just things falling out of my brain in the time it takes to write anything, but I do want to be able to also have some shortcuts to useful things like messaging people or adding events to a calendar.

Here's some very very baseline features, with steps that start it off as kind of ass but usable and get increasingly cushy. At the start, this is going to more closely resemble a workflow.
1. Device independence (necessary because if I don't have all this shit in one place I will literally die) 
	- Subfeatures:
		1. API that gives feedback and actually does the thing instantly and whatever.
			1. Hosted locally.
			2. Port forwarded and junk.
		2. Saves would-be commands to a file, which is synced through SyncThing, which I already have set up. It gets to it when it gets to it.
	- Plan
		1. Add 1.2.
		2. Add 1.1.1. 1.2 is still used when I'm out of the house.
		3. Add 1.1.2. 1.2 is still used when I don't have an internet connection.
2. Ability to say things out loud into my phone or computer and review their contents later
	- Subfeatures:
		1. Possible through my computer
		2. Possible through my phone...
			1. ...via a hotkey (if I have a keyboard or something. or maybe I could bind the power button to it. idk)
			2. ...via lock screen widget (which I sure hope I can get access to)
		3. Saved in a way that can be accessed for later review. Related to 1.
	- Plan:
		1. Whichever of 2.2.x is easier to set up. Probably 2.2.2. Also 2.3.
		2. Add 2.1.
		3. Add whichever 2.2.x wasn't added previously.

Uhhhhhh that's probably enough for now?? Like there's no actual command system here but if I can record shit then I can kind of start recording shit right away you know?
